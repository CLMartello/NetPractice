# NetPractice

NetPractice is a networking exercise from 42 School designed to teach and validate core networking concepts through interactive problem-solving. The project progressively introduces IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and packet forwarding using visual network topologies. The goal is to correctly configure IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing tables so that all required hosts can communicate successfully.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to study networking through practical exercises, complete all 10 levels, and understand the core concepts of computer networks. Each exercise is described by level in this repository.

## Core Concepts

1. IPv4 Addressing

An IPv4 address is composed of 4 octets, split into a network part and a host part. IPv4 addresses range from:
